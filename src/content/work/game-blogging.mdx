<h3>background</h3>
as i have been playing more story-driven games, my sister and i often discuss new characters, events, and quests. 
often, we reference posts from on social media platforms like twitter, reddit and tiktok. in larger fandoms, there is 
no shortage of content: personality breakdowns, design analyses, lore deep dives, and funny moments. 
<br />

the challenge is that finding these posts later is almost impossible, unless you saved them yourself. for a new 
player experiencing old content, discovering posts from the original release period is incredibly difficult. even 
when posts on social media platforms are tagged, it is usually only with the game's IP, making discovery of old 
content inconsistent. 
<br/>

i set out to create a web app where posts tied to specific game questsand storylines can be organized, categorized, 
and revisisted long after release.
<br />

<h3>features demo</h3>

<br />

<h4>create a new post</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/1.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt"></p>
  </Medium>
</div>
users can create posts tied to specific stories across four games. each game has its own categorization system.
for example, <i>Genshin Impact</i> has three types of story content: <b>Flagship Events</b>, <b>Story Quests</b>, 
and <b>Archon Quests</b>. Archon Quests can be further divided into chapters.
<br />

to create a post, users select a game (or enter the name of another), provide a title and rating, and optionally 
select a story and enter body content.
<br />

<h4>sort posts by date, likes, or comments</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/2.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt"></p>
  </Medium>
</div>
on the global home page, following feed, and on each game's page, posts can be sorted by 
creation time, likes on posts, or comments (referred to as "Activity").
<br />

<h4>filter posts by game</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/3.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt"></p>
  </Medium>
</div>
each game has its own homepage where users can browse only posts related to that game. sidebars lets users 
filter by stories. there is also an "All Other Games" page for uncategorized posts.
<br />

<h4>filter posts by a game's story</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/4.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt"></p>
  </Medium>
</div>
users can navigate directly to feeds for specific stories either through a sidebar link or by clicking on 
a categorized post.
<br />

<h4>view and respond to a comment</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/5.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt">view a comment's thread and write a comment</p>
  </Medium>
</div>
comments can be viewed as thread posts. clicking on the comment count opens an editor for writing a reply.
<br />

<h4>follow a user</h4>
<div className="mt-4">
  <Medium>
      <img src="/content/game-blogging/6.gif" className="medium"/>
      <p class="medium-alt"></p>
  </Medium>
</div>
users can follow other users to ensure their posts appear in the following feed.
<br />

<h3> tech stack & development </h3>
\>> <b>React</b>: matched frontend types with backend models for type safety. connected a React frontend to a 
.NET 9 backend.

\>> <b>React Bootstrap</b>: utilized prebuilt components to accelerate frontend development.

\>> <b>.NET 9 & Entity Framework</b>: learned .NET from scratch, built a REST API, and worked with SQLite locally 
before deploying to PostgreSQL. implemented registration and login with encrypted credentials.

\>> <b>Azeru & PostgreSQL</b>: gained hands-on experience deploying frontend, backend and database in the cloud.
<br />

<h3>key takeaways</h3>
this project reflects my ability to:

\>> build a simple, cohesive and functional frontend from scratch

\>> implement authentication and authorization 

\>> work end-to-end across frontend, backend, and database layers

\>> adapt quickly to new frameworks and technologies

this was my first full-stack web application, built primarily as a backend project with a frontend in plain html/css/js. although it was 
originally developed for a course in programming safe systems,  it gave me valuable experience in building and deploying a complete application.
<br/>
in april 2025, i revisited after some experience in hosting, and it has since been live <a href="https://kizuna-maker.mooo.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #fef08a"><u>here</u></a>.

<br />

this idea was inspired by the kizuna (trust) rank feature in <i>Project SEKAI: COLORFUL STAGE!</i>, where users can build the trust between 
two characters by pairing them in the first two slots when teambuilding. at the time, there was a very limited amount of pairings, so fandom 
communities would edit their own pairings or use pairings in the game with their own text. i created this application to automate that process.

<Carousel media={[
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/01.webp", "global server: in-game examples pt. 1."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/02.webp", "global server: in-game examples pt. 2."],
]} client:only="react" />
<br/>

for image generation, i used the cairo-rs library in Rust. while powerful, it was difficult to work with becuase the documentation was sparse 
and what i was able to find largely referenced implementations in C and Perl, which weren't 1:1 with the Rust binding. i experiemented with 
other libraries, but Cairo was the only one with most of the features i wanted.

<Carousel media={[
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/05.webp", "ex 1: strokes would get thicker inwards rather than outwards."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/07.webp", "ex 2: strokes would get thicker inwards rather than outwards."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/09.webp", "by instead drawing the text in two layers, it appears as an outer stroke rather than an inner one."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/10.webp", "before adding support for longer strings, it would all spill into the second line."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/11.webp", "after adding support for longer strings, it splits between the two lines."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/12.webp", "centering text horizontally and vertically when contained within one line."],
  ["/content/kizuna-maker/13.webp", "centering text horizontally and the Context vertically when contained in two lines."],
]} client:only="react" />

this project gave me hand-on experience with:

  \>> full-stack development from scratch

  \>> working with third-party libraries with limited documentation
  
  \>> discovering and handling edge cases

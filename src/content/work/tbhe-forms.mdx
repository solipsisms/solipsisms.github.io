<h3>background</h3>
in a team of nine students, we delegated roles, planned out the infrastructure, designed, built and tested software in an agile-style 
development cycle for a client of a non-profit organization. our goal was to consolidate the organization's current intake process for 
participants of their yearly Trade Day and monthly Academy Day events, as they were using Google Forms, Eventbrite, and Mailchimp. over four weeks,
we delivered a web application that consolidated the tools of Google Forms and Eventbrite, creating one home for paid and unpaid registrations 
alike, while also eliminating some of the manual work associated with Mailchimp.
<br/>

<Carousel media={[
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/01.webp", "view of the admin dashboard. colors are used to distinguish between trade day and academy events. the admin can also see how many spots are currently occupied, and open a menu for each form."],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/02.webp", "participant view: a sample form's information header. the text can be customized with italics, bold and underline, the location and date(s) are at the top, with remaining spots just underneath."],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/03.webp", "additional questions can be of type radio button, checkboxes, text, date, and number. depending on the spots remaining, or if the form is paid, the submit button changes correspondingly."],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/05.webp", "the admin can export data to a csv file to be imported into mailchimp, delete participants, and see if there are any pending payments or participants on the wailist."],
]} client:only="react" />
<br/>

<h3>my role: webmaster</h3>
<b>as i was primarily responsible for hosting and deployment i:</b>

-set up a (L)inux (A)pache (M)ongoDB (Py)thon stack on an AWS EC2 instance.

-configured Apache to serve static files and proxy API requests to the backend.

-built and managed a MongoDB Community Server with the CLI.

-implemeneted environment-based API calls with Axios so the app could switch seamlessly between local and production environments.

-monitored GitHub changes and made PRs with deployment adjustments before rebuilding on the server.
<br />

<b>however, i also worked on and collaborated on other critical features:</b>

-<b>Stripe payment processing:</b> prepared server security and worked closely with another teammate to test successful, failed and timed-out 
payments.

-<b>Transactional emails:</b> designed, implemented and tested automated emails triggered by registration status (successful, waitlisted, 
failed/timeout).

-<b>Documentation:</b> co-authored parts of the developer guide detailing the server stack for future maintainers.
<br />

below are the transactional emails mentioned above.
<Carousel media={[
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/06.webp", "transactional email: successful registration"],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/07.webp", "transactional email: waitlisted"],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/08.webp", "transactional email: unsuccessful payment"],
  ["/content/tbhe-forms/09.webp", "transactional email: successful payment"],

<h3>reflection</h3>

after the forming of our teams, our professor led with the lack of an obligation to implement payment, as it had 
proved too difficult for teams in the past. <i>trailblazers</i>, as they called us, we were inspired and dedicated to 
be the first to provide a client with the native ability to accept payment. and, we did it.
<br />

this project also gave me real experience in:

-working in a large team, Agile-style

-Git collaboration (especially during “the great merge”)

-deployment, API integration, and server security in a live client project

  this project was delivered to a real client on an AWS instance for internal purposes. i cannot provide a public demo, but the

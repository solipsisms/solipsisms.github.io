<br />

this project is a fan-made chat generator for <i>Genshin Impact</i>, inspired by similar tools for 
<a href="https://hsrchat.pages.dev" target="_blank" style="color: #fef08a"><u><i>Honkai: Star Rail</i></u></a> and 
<a href="https://zenless.tools/chat-generator" target="_blank" style="color: #fef08a"><u><i>Zenless Zone Zero</i></u></a>.
while those communities had their own generators, <i>Genshin Impact</i>, despite having the largest playbase, did not. players would rely on 
non-native tools with custom imports, so i was heavily inspired to build a version specifically for <i>Genshin Impact</i>.

<h3> design & ui </h3>

to achieve a cohesive look, i studied the in-game interface and designed custom SVG icons using Figma to capture the essence of 
<i>Genshin Impact</i>. i paid attention to how the other chat generators emulated their respective games' ui and adapted that approach 
for consistency. since <i>Genshin Impact</i> characters do not have phones to communicate with each other as they do in <i>Honkai: Star Rail</i>
and <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i>, i based this chat generator off of the in-game chat capability between players. the resulting interface includes 
adjustments to the design that are inspired by the game's ui rather than a direct replication, ensuring clarity and usability for users.

<h3>key features</h3>
\>> create, edit, delete, and reorder messages

\>> switch message sides and change characters 

\>> upload images and add custom characters

\>> save chats locally for future editing  

\>> export complete conversations as shareable images

<br />

<h3> tech stack & development </h3>
\>> <b>React (Next.js)</b>: i furthered my understanding of component abstraction, the Context API and clean state management.

\>> <b>Typescript</b>: became more comfortable utilizing type safety, making debugging and refactoring much smoother than my past experiences 
with Javascript.

\>> <b>TailwindCSS & shadcn/ui</b>: greatly accelerated my ability to execute the design and styling, also providing customizable components like 
modals, popovers and alerts. 

\>> <b>Cloudflare Pages</b>: enabled easy deployment by providing preview subdomains for development branches and a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.

<h3> key takeaways </h3>
this project significantly improved my frontend skills, from comfort with React's ecosystem to designing a user interface from scratch with 
references and testing it's capability on different screen sizes and devices. this project was also a chance to identify a gap in the fan 
community and provide a solution that directly accommodates that need.
